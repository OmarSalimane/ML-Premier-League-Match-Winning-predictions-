Football Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning
In this project, I designed and implemented a Random Forest Classifier to predict football match results based on key performance indicators. The model achieved 85% accuracy and 82% precision on test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting match outcomes.

To enhance predictive performance, I conducted data pre-processing and feature engineering, incorporating crucial factors such as expected goals (xG), possession percentage, match venue, and opponent strength. These features were carefully selected based on their impact on match results, ensuring the model captured key patterns in team performance.

Model evaluation was performed using confusion matrix analysis and feature importance ranking to assess prediction reliability and identify the most influential factors contributing to match results. The insights gained from this analysis provided a deeper understanding of how different variables affect game outcomes.

The project was developed using Python, leveraging powerful data science libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling, model training, visualization, and performance assessment.

This model can be further improved by integrating additional features, tuning hyperparameters, or experimenting with advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy. Future developments could also include real-time data updates and predictive analytics for betting or team strategy optimization.
